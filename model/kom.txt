What is Kommunitas?
​Kommunitas is a decentralized crowdfunding ecosystem for web3.0 projects. Some might refer to it as a "launchpad" or "IDO Platform" but Kommunitas is aiming to build not only a platform, but more to an ecosystem.
Kommunitas not only provides fundraising for any type web3.0 projects from various blockchain (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, Avax, Fantom, Arbitrum, etc), but also other forms of support, such as Marketing, Community Management, KOL and VC Connections, SEO and even project development needs such as vesting portal and staking platform.
Since its inception, Kommunitas has introduced and been pioneers of many interesting concepts in the web3.0 industry. Some of them are Initial KOMmunity Offering / IKO (tierless, no barrier and decentralized IDO) and Social Engagement Burning (a way of rewarding the community by reducing circulation supply of the token based on engagement metrics across social media).
Not only investors will get capital gain from their investment of Public sale tokens, they are also presented with the opportunity to earn passive Revenue Sharing in Stable Coin as well as in KOM Token by holding and staking KOM token. (Read more about Revenue Sharing here : https://docs.kommunitas.net/staking/quarterly-revenue-sharing). Or visit https://earn.kommunitas.net to understand all earning opportunities.
Kommunitas has 8 main features that make it stands out from other competitors:
1. Tier-Less System
The amount of allocation a user receives is proportional to the amount of KOM they stake, with no tiers and barriers to entry. This means all KOM holders will have a chance to participate in our Launchpad, regardless of their comfortable investment limit, ridding them of any stress induced when they’re required to hold a minimum number of tokens to participate in a Public Sale. So, the more KOM token they staked, the more allocation they will get.
2. Revenue Sharing
This feature is only for Private Partners. 30% of the fees collected from our FCFS and Community Rounds will be pooled into the Private Partners Treasury Wallet. The funds (in USDC) collected will then be shared amongst our Private Partners (Wallets with more than 500,000 KOM staked) at the end of each quarter.

For those who owns and stakes more than 10,000,000 KOM, we identify them as KOM Millionaire Partners and we take 5% out of our monthly revenue and distribute with them proportionally.

Kommunitas Revealed: How Kommunitas is Changing the Crypto Crowfunding
Introduction
In the ever-evolving landscape of Web3, choosing the right platform for decentralized crowdfunding is crucial. Kommunitas stands out as a leader in this realm, offering an array of unique benefits for not only crypto startups but also for retail investors.
Background of Kommunitas
At its heart, Kommunitas is a Decentralized Crowdfunding Ecosystem, governed by the $KOM token. It provides a robust solution for decentralized fundraising in Web3.0, serving as a one-stop solution with a variety of features and services.
Kommunitas Features
Kommunitas distinguishes itself in the competitive crypto space with four key features:
1. Tier-Less System
Kommunitas has a special system that ensures all users who hold KOM tokens get a fair chance to participate in their Launchpad projects. It’s designed to be inclusive. The key is simple: the more KOM tokens a user stakes, the more they can get involved in the projects. There’s no need for a minimum number of tokens, so every user has the opportunity to participate, regardless of how many tokens they hold or stake in Kommunitas staking platform.
This approach removes the stress and barriers, allowing every user, whether they staked a small or large amount of KOM, to be a part of the exciting Launchpad projects. For details on how the allocation mechanism is calculated, please refer to the article linked here.
2. Revenue Sharing
Kommunitas offers a unique profit-sharing model that benefits its partners in two main ways, which no other launchpad has this unique feature.
- Quarterly Revenue Sharing for KOM Private Partners
Every quarter, we distribute a portion of our earnings among our Private Partners. This is done by allocating 30% of the fees collected from certain rounds, like First Come, First Served (FCFS) and Community Rounds. The money, held in USDC, is pooled into a special Treasury Wallet. From here, it’s shared with those who have staked more than 500,000 KOM. This quarterly sharing ensures a regular benefit for our dedicated partners.
For more information about Private Partners, please visit this link.
- Monthly Rewards for KOM Millionaire Partners
Users who go a step further by staking over 10,000,000 KOM are recognized as KOM Millionaire Partners. Being Kommunitas Millionaire Partners enjoy an exclusive benefit. We share 5% of our monthly revenue and distribute it among them, with the amount each partner receives depending on their stake proportion.
For more information on how to join our Millionaire Partner program, please refer to this article.
- Kommunitas Priority Projects Offering
Our Priority Projects are chosen because they agreed to met our high standards, ensuring both quality and safety for our investors.
Here’s what’s new and important in our Priority Projects initiative:
Improved Refund Policy with Airdrop Benefits: We’ve updated our refund policy. Now, if a project’s token price drops significantly right after listing, not only will investors get a full refund, but they will also keep their initial tokens as a free airdrop. This change is about giving more value back to our investors.
These updates reflect our dedication to enhancing the benefits for our investors and encouraging accountability in projects. We believe these changes make Kommunitas a safer and more rewarding environment for everyone involved.
To learn more about our Priority Projects, kindly visit this link.
- Kommunitas Secure IKO Offering
Kommunitas Secure IKO is our latest feature, designed to balance strict security with more opportunities for high-quality projects. We’ve learned from our past experiences: being too strict sometimes limits the range of projects and can lead to unexpected outcomes.
Here’s what Secure IKO brings to the table:
1. Easy and Empowering Refund Process
The refund procedure within Secure IKO is straightforward, reflecting our commitment to a decentralized, trust-based platform. Requesting a refund is as simple as your initial commitment — no complicated forms, just a few clicks.
2. User Control and Convenience
We respect your time and security. With Kommunitas, you have total control over your investment. Support the project or opt for a full refund within a 3-day window — all made hassle-free and user-friendly.
3. Balanced Selection Criteria
Our revised criteria maintain high standards but are more accommodating to exceptional projects. This new approach attracts reputable projects, offering them a structured and trustworthy introduction to our community. It also simplifies their access to funds and the refund process.
To learn more about our Secure IKO, kindly visit this link.
Ways to Earn Free Tokens:
- Vote, Share, and Buy Rewards (VSB)
The essence of this program is that if users meet the specified criteria, they’ll receive bonus project tokens. This means that for the same amount of money, if users purchase through Kommunitas, they’ll receive more tokens compared to buying the same project on other launchpads. According to our data, users typically get an average of 14% extra tokens from the 42x distribution of VSB. The history of reward distribution can be viewed here.
To understand how to join a VSB campaign for one of our projects, check out this example: ICON. X WORLD VSB Campaign.
- Learn 2 Earn (L2E)
Kommunitas offers users the chance to earn project tokens by getting involved in current fundraisers. The process is simple: users just need to learn about the project and correctly answer quiz questions. In doing this, users can earn project tokens, each with a minimum value of $10. This presents a unique opportunity where learning actually pays off. For those who like to spend time browsing content, this is an ideal way to earn rewards while relaxing.
To understand how to join a Learn 2 Earn for one of our projects, check out this article: ICON.X WORLD L2E Campaign.
- Airdrop
When projects raise funds through Kommunitas, they often provide airdrops of free tokens as a token of appreciation for contributions. Users of Kommunitas have the opportunity to receive these airdrops without needing to make any financial investment. The only requirement is for users to complete straightforward tasks on social media platforms. The value of these airdrops can vary, ranging from tens to hundreds of dollars in project tokens. Additionally, completing a task for an airdrop typically takes less than five minutes. This is a proven system, as numerous airdrops have already been successfully conducted, with tokens distributed to participants. For verification of the reward distribution history, users can visit this link.

- Ask Me Anything (AMA)
A program offered by Kommunitas, similar to its Learn2Earn initiative. This unique feature involves direct interaction with project leaders who are in the process of raising funds on Kommunitas, usually conducted through Twitter Spaces or Telegram Group Chats. Participants in these sessions can pose questions, and if their queries are selected by the speakers, they receive rewards. These rewards range from a minimum of $10 to a maximum of $20. Additionally, participants who actively promote the AMA’s featured project on Galxe as part of the Kommunitas campaign are eligible for an extra $10 bonus.

Users interested in viewing the history of these reward distributions can do so by visiting this link.

Currently, over 1 billion KOM tokens are staked on the platform, representing 61% of the total circulating supply of 1.68 billion KOM. Additionally, staked KOM tokens at Kommunitas are eligible for Compounding Interest, which means the earnings of users can increase exponentially over time, creating a snowball effect in their investment growth.

1. What is Kommunitas?
​Kommunitas is a decentralized crowdfunding ecosystem for web3.0 projects. Some might refer to it as a "launchpad" or "IDO Platform" but Kommunitas is aiming to build not only a platform, but more to an ecosystem.
Kommunitas not only provides fundraising for any type web3.0 projects from various blockchain (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, Avax, Fantom, etc), but also other forms of support, such as Marketing, Community Management, KOL and VC Connections, SEO and even project development needs such as vesting portal and staking platform.
Since its inception, Kommunitas has introduced and been pioneers of many interesting concepts in the web3.0 industry. Some of them are Initial KOMmunity Offering / IKO (tierless, no barrier and decentralized IDO) and Social Engagement Burning (a way of rewarding the community by reducing circulation supply of the token based on engagement metrics across social media)
Not only investors will get capital gain from their investment of Public sale tokens, they are also presented with the opportunity to earn passive Revenue Sharing in Stable Coin as well as in KOM Token by holding and staking KOM token. (Read more about Revenue Sharing here : https://docs.kommunitas.net/staking/quarterly-revenue-sharing) Or visit https://earn.kommunitas.net to understand all earning opportunities.
2. Why name it Kommunitas?
Kommunitas was inspired by the original word of Community, which is from the Latin word Communitas, meaning “the same”. Therefore, Kommunitas is a community, which share the same vision and goal to get a capital gain in the cryptocurrency space.
3. What makes Kommunitas stand out from other Launchpad?
1. Tier-Less System The amount of allocation a user receives is proportional to the amount of $KOM they stake, with no tiers and barriers to entry. This means all $KOM holders will have a chance to participate in our Launchpad, regardless of their comfortable investment limit, ridding them of any stress induced when they’re required to hold a minimum number of tokens to participate in a Public Sale. So, the more KOM token they staked, the more allocation they will get.
2. Revenue Sharing This feature is only for Private Partners. 30% of the fees collected from our FCFS and Community Rounds will be pooled into the Private Partners Treasury Wallet. The funds (in USDC) collected will then be shared amongst our Private Partners (Wallets with more than 500K KOM staked) at the end of each quarter.
